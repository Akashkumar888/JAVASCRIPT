// ⭐ 4. HTML + CSS + JavaScript vs React — Why Use React?
// ✔ When building UI using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:
// DOM manipulation is manual, meaning you must select elements and update them yourself.
// Code becomes long, repetitive, and messy as the application grows.
// Re-rendering UI after data changes is difficult and error-prone.
// There is no component structure, so repeating UI parts becomes hard.
// Large projects become hard to maintain because logic and UI mix together.
// Updating one part of the UI may accidentally affect others.

// ⭐ Advantages of Using React
// ✔ 1. Component-Based Architecture
// React breaks the UI into small, reusable components.
// Each component manages its own logic and UI, making code cleaner and modular.

// ✔ 2. Virtual DOM for Better Performance
// React creates a virtual copy of the DOM.
// It compares changes and updates only the necessary parts, making UI updates faster and more efficient.

// ✔ 3. Built-in State Management
// React provides tools like useState, useReducer, and Context API to manage data easily.
// For larger apps, libraries like Redux or Recoil integrate smoothly.

// ✔ 4. Hooks Simplify Logic
// React Hooks like useState, useEffect, useContext, and useRef allow you to use state and lifecycle features without writing classes.

// ✔ 5. Routing Support
// React works with React Router to create Single Page Applications (SPA) where pages change without reloading the browser.

// ✔ 6. Huge Ecosystem
// React has a massive ecosystem with:
// UI libraries
// Form libraries
// Animation libraries
// State management tools
// There is strong community support and many ready-made solutions.

// ✔ 7. Single Page Application (SPA) Development
// React allows building SPAs where:
// Only required components update
// Page does not reload
// User experience becomes smooth and fast

// ✔ 8. Reusable Components Everywhere
// Common UI parts like buttons, navbars, cards, footers, and forms can be reused across many pages.
// This reduces code duplication and speeds up development.
